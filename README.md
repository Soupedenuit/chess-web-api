# Overview

chess-web-api is a lightweight unofficial wrapper for the [Chess.com Published-Data API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api). 

It includes helper functions for [all the endpoints](#all-functions), such as [player profile data](#get-players-profile), [current daily chess](#get-players-current-daily-chess-games), [monthly archives](#get-players-completed-monthly-archives), [clubs](#get-a-club), [tournaments](#get-a-tournament) and [more](#all-functions).

Please read Chess.com's [notes on data currency, language and rate limits on parallel requests](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api). They're good to know before you implement this into your work.


I'll try to keep this library updated if they're API changes, feel free to submit any [issues](https://github.com/andyruwruw/chess-web-api/issues).

# Additional Features

## Priority Queue
**chess-web-api** can be initialized with a [priority queue](#usage-with-queue) for requests to prevent parallel requests. Requests will be sent as soon as the previous returns. 

Using the queue requires passing in a **callback function** for the result to be sent to.

## Query for Changes

[Chess.com Published-Data API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) also allows clients to provide an **etag** from a previous response to check if data since the last request has changed. 

This has been implemented into chess-web-api's [ifChanged function](#query-doc) to make any of the requests.

# Installation

Install via node:

    $ npm install -S chess-web-api

Then, in your javascript file
```
var ChessWebAPI = require('chess-web-api');

var chessAPI = new ChessWebAPI();
```
If you wish to use the built in [priority queue](#usage-with-queue) to avoid parallel requests, add the following parameter to the constructor:
```
var chessAPI = new ChessWebAPI({
    queue: true
});
```
---

## Usage (Without Queue)

To use chess-web-api, once you've created an instance of the library, call any of the functions on it.
```
var ChessWebAPI = require('chess-web-api');

var chessAPI = new ChessWebAPI();

chessAPI.getPlayer('andyruwruw')
    .then(function(response) {
        console.log('Player Profile', response.body);
    }, function(err) {
        console.error(err);
    });

chessAPI.getTitledPlayers('GM')
    .then(function(response) {
        console.log('Grand Masters', response.body.players);
    }, function(err) {
        console.error(err);
    });
```
---

## Usage (With Queue)

[Chess.com's API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api#game-results) doesn't rate limit unless you've made parallel requests. If you have more than two active requests at a time, you'll receive a **429 Too Many Requests** error. 

To add something to the queue, use the method **dispatch**.
```
.dispatch(method, callback, parameters, options, priority, callbackParameters)
```
### Parameters:

| Name       | Type       | Description                                       |
|------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| method     | **function** | **chess-web-api** function for request.             |
| callback   | **function** | Function to be called with result                 |
| parameters | **array**    | Array of parameters to be passed into the method. |
| options    | **object**   | Added options to the end of the URL (optional)    |
| priority   | **number**   | Priority in queue (1 is heighest priority) (optional)|
| callbackParameters   | **array**   | Array of parameters to be passed on to the callback method along with the response. (optional)|

### Returns: **object**

### Callback: 

The provided callback method will be provided two parameters: **(response, error)**.

Response is the full request result.

Additional parameters can be passed to the callback in **callbackParameters**.

The dispatch function determines the difference between **parameters** to be passed into the **chessAPI method** vs the **callback function** by order. 

The **first array** passed into dispatch will always be passed into the **chessAPI method**. 

The **second array** will always be sent to the **callback function**, with the **response to the request as the first parameter**. See example above.

### Example: 

```
var ChessWebAPI = require('chess-web-api');

var chessAPI = new ChessWebAPI({
    queue: true,
});

let printResults = function(response, error, sampleParameter1, sampleParameter2) {
    console.log(response.body);
    console.log(sampleParameter1);
    console.log(sampleParameter2);
}

chessAPI.dispatch(chessAPI.getPlayer, printResults, ["andyruwruw"], {}, 1, ["callbackParameter", "anotherCallbackParameter"]);
chessAPI.dispatch(chessAPI.getTitledPlayers, printResults, ["GM"]);
chessAPI.dispatch(chessAPI.getPlayerCurrentDailyChess, printResults, ["andyruwruw"], ["callbackParameter"]);
chessAPI.dispatch(chessAPI.getPlayerCompleteMonthlyArchives, printResults, ["andyruwruw", 2019, 10], {}, ["callback parameter"]);
```

If you initialize your **ChessWebAPI** with the queue enabled, you can still call any of the regular functions without using the queue.

```
var ChessWebAPI = require('chess-web-api');

var chessAPI = new ChessWebAPI({
    queue: true,
});

chessAPI.getTitledPlayers('GM')
    .then(function(response) {
        console.log('Grand Masters', response.body.players);
    }, function(err) {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

---
## Clear the Queue
```
.clearQueue()
```

### Description: 
*Should you wish the clear the queue you can run the following method.*

### Example: 

```
var ChessWebAPI = require('chess-web-api');

var chessAPI = new ChessWebAPI({
    queue: true,
});

let printResults = function(response, error) {
    console.log(response.body);
}

chessAPI.dispatch(chessAPI.getPlayer, printResults, ["andyruwruw"], {}, 1, ["callbackParameter", "anotherCallbackParameter"]);

chessAPI.clearQueue();
```

### Returns: **Object**

**ifChanged** allows you to make any of the helper functions with the added parameter of the **etag** provided in the header of the last similar request.

ifChanged will return either of the following:

```
// If data has changed, response is attached.
{
    changed: true,
    response: // response from chess.com
}

// If data has not been updated.
{
    changed: false,
}
```

Example:
```
var games, etag;

// Gets the games and stores an etag.
var trackGames = async function() {
    let response = await chessAPI.getPlayerCurrentDailyChess('andyruwruw');
    games = response.body.games;
    etag = response.headers.etag;

    // runs checkGames every 10 seconds.
    setInterval(checkGames, 10000);
}

var checkGames = async function() {
    // Makes the request but with ifChanged
    let gamesChanged = await chessAPI.ifChanged(etag, chessAPI.getPlayerCurrentDailyChess, ['andyruwruw']);

    // Updates variables if new data is available.
    if (gamesChanged.changed) {
        games = gamesChanged.response.body.games;
        etag = gamesChanged.response.headers.etag;
    }
}

trackGames();
